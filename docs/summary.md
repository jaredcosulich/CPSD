		<h2 id="content">Overall</h2>
		<p>
			In general I don't think the data points to any obvious red flags, but it does
			raise some questions in my mind, which I've detailed below.
		</p>

		<h2 id="content">Budget Prioritization</h2>
		<p>
			I find it curious that Cambridge
			is spending relatively more on "Insurance, Retirement, and Other" and "Administration"
			then it is on teachers (see <a href='../overview'>Budget Overview</a>). Could this mean
			that we aren't providing enough classroom support given the size of the budget. It's
			hard to say conclusively from the data, but the data does seem to raise that question.
		</p>

		<h2 id="content">Teachers</h2>
		<p>
			For the most part teachers in Cambridge are doing ok. From a budget perspective
			they are paid relatively well compared to other districts in the state and
			have a relatively low student to teacher ratio as can be seen on the
			<a href="../teachers">Teachers</a> page.
		</p>
		<p>
			However when you take into account the complexity of Cambridge as a district,
			with the communities significant income inequality and the high cost of living,
			teachers in Cambridge look worse off. Comparatively speaking, when looking at
			the Greater Boston Area, Cambridge is in similar territory as Lexington,
			Newton, Weston, and Wellesley with regards to housing prices and teacher salaries,
			but those communities don't have the same diversity of student body that
			Cambridge has.
		</p>

		<h2 id="content">More To Come</h2>
		<p>
			This is an ongoing exploration and will be updated periodically.
