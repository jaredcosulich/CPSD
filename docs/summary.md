		<p>
			In general I don't think the data points to any obvious red flags, but it does
			raise some questions in my mind, which I've detailed below.

		<h2 id="content">Budget Prioritization</h2>
		<p>
			I find it curious that Cambridge
			is spending relatively more on "Insurance, Retirement, and Other" and "Administration"
			then it is on teachers (see <a href='../overview'>Budget Overview</a>). Could this mean
			that we aren't providing enough classroom support given the size of the budget. It's
			hard to say conclusively from the data, but the data does seem to raise that question.

		<h2 id="content">More To Come</h2>

			This is an ongoing exploration and will be updated periodically.
