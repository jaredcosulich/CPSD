This site is a side project put together by Jared Cosulich.

It is budget season again for Cambridge Public Schools.
Despite many casual attempts to understand the budget since my children started in CPSD  
I still don't feel like I have a good handle on the budget. This makes it difficult to
advocate for any changes as an informed citizen.

I know that Cambridge spends more than most districts in MA per student (around $27k)
but I don't know if that is the right amount of money to spend. Cambridge is a complicated
district with a lot of schools and a diverse population of students. Maybe it needs more money
to handle the complexity and provide equitable experiences for all students.

So I built this website to explore the budget from a variety of different angles. It also
gave me an excuse to play around with some technologies ([D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) that I have been curious about, hence the somewhat fancy
looking website for a side project.

It's a work-in-progress so it will be evolving as time goes on.
