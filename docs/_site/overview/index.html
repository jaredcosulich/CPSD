                    An attempt to breakdown the overall CPSD budget from a few perspectives.

  <h2>How is the budget allocated?</h2>

  <p>
    This was the first question I had. So I found a breakdown of the budget on the
    <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/finance/statistics/ppx13-17.html" target="_blank">Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education</a> website. You can download the data
    <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/finance/statistics/ppx13-17.xlsx">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This graph shows the breakdown. You can mouse over or click into any section to see the detailed
    breakdown.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's hard to draw any significant observations from this data although it's interesting to see how the budget is allocated. It immediately made me wonder how this allocation compares to other districts and the state average.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I created the chart below that shows the relative spending in each of these categories across
    Cambridge, Boston, Somerville, and the state average. These different districts have different budgets so the relative spending doesn't provide the whole picture, but it is still interesting.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can mouse over each circle to see the raw budget numbers as well.
  </p>

  <div class="clear">
    <div id="allDESE2017Data" class="graph-left"></div>

    <p>
      Overall it seems Cambridge has a similar distribution of budget when compared to
      Somerville, Boston, and the state totals. There are some differences, though,
      with Cambridge allocating considerably less (by percentage) to teachers when
      compared to the state totals, but Cambridge is also allocating more to
      "Insurance, Retirement Programs, and Other" which may factor in some part
      of the overall teacher compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambridge is also relatively high on the percentage of the budget allocated
      to administration, but administration doesn't represent a significant allocation
      in any district. If Cambridge were to allocate similar amounts to administration
      as other districts it would only affect the budget by 1.4%.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, with the budget in Cambridge, 1.4% of the budget in 2017 was close to $3 million,
      which would pay for around 33 additional teachers. Given the relative lack of spending
      for teachers in Cambridge, maybe those additional teachers would be more effective...
